# Text-based-rpg
A small text-based RPG I made for my final project in Data Structures, it's based on an adjacency matrix.
Main program file is DandD.java

Initial Upload 2/22/2016, Basic Features:
1) Save/Load Character from Text File
2) Create a Character with choice of four races and four classes.
3) Basic leveling-up system
4) Basic turn-base combat system
5) Item and Key based progression through game

Short-Term Goals:
1) Save state of player in dungeon
2) Equipable Items, i.e. Armor, swords, tomes
3) Add dungeon floors
4) Damage over time abilites and Status ailments, more strategic combat
5) Dungeon Hazards
6) Anything else

Long Term-Goals:
1) Basic GUI
2) Build on Game Engine with sprites
3) Turn game into small phone application for Android
